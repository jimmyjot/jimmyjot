I'm Jim Tarsi. I've been in software-related industries most of my career. This GitHub site is for personal projects, mostly games. I'm currently working on an application for a game called Mating Season, which was described in a Games magazine many years ago.
The rules are in the file "Mating Season Rules.docx" and "Mating Season Rules.txt".
